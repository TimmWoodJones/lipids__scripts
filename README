This document outlines the organization and contents of this folder: many python scripts which analyze the simulations, calculate and store new data arrays, and plots certain data. The following is a list and description of these scripts.

-[XY]_plotting.py: plots the values of thermodynamic values X and Y for a number of simulations

-calc_all.py: runs scripts "phase_calc.py" and "hist_calc.py" for many simulations

-dens_hist_calc.py: now-redundant script that calculates the density of a simulation by dividing the system into a grid and count the density of each grid for each printed timestep; outputs a numpy-array that can be used to plot a histogram

-ext_traj_maker.py: reads trajectory file of a simulation and outputs numpy arrays of the x-,y-, and z-positions of the top atom and of the spin of the lipid

-grid_density_calc.py: defunct script, old version of dens_hist_calc.py

-grid_plot.py: unfinished, unrefined script to plot histogram arrays on a 2d color map

-hex_mod_traj_maker.py: makes a new version of a simulation's trajectory file where the z-coordinate is replaced by the modulus of that atoms hexagonal order

-hex_proj_traj_maker.py: makes a new version of a simulation's trajectory file where the z-coordinate is replaced by the projection of the atom's hexagonal order onto the mean hexagonal order

-hist_calcs.py: calculates histograms of density of particles, average modulus of hexagonal order, average spin, and the volume for a single simulation and outputs numpy arrays

-hist_plot.py: plots and saves histogram of a single step or all steps from a histogram calculated by "hist_calcs.py"

-make_[X]_movie.py: makes a movie of quantity [X] out of frames produced by either "hist_plot.py" or "plot_[X]_traj.py"

-make_timestep_config.py: makes new configuration file from a particular time step to run a new simulation starting from that timestep, additionally prints the temperature at that timestep so that value can be changed in the input file

-movie_maker.py: takes in frames and makes a movie, embedded in "make_[X]_movie.py" scripts

-phase_calc.py: analyzes trajectory.lammpstrj and log.dat files for a simulation and outputs temperature, pressure, magnetization, and average hexatic order in numpy-arrays

-plot_[X]_traj.py: plots and saves x- and y-coordinates of a single step or all steps of a simulation colored by the value of quantity X

volume_plot.py: makes a plot of volume vs. time for a single simulation
